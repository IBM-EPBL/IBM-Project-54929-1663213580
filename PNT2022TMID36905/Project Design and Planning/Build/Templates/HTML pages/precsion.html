      <h3>
        Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress
        in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in
        hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have them in their
        house backyard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to
        breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a
        drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher rate of
        mortality without causing injury to children. Children under six of
        their age are found to be suffering the highest drowning mortality rates
        worldwide. Such kinds of deaths account for the third cause of unplanned
        death globally, with about 1.2 million cases yearly. To overcome this
        conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming
        pools to save human life.
